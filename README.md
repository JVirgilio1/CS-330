Project File is >25MB, so Github will not let me upload it.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I knew almost nothing about OpenGl, so everything I learned from this course was new.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed smart design decisions, allowing for the creation of a repetable block of code that let me add new pieces whenever I needed them.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Keeping a well written and concise block of code to do a specific task lets you create a synergistic program.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Using reflections, patterns, and solid colors to create a scene in a 3D environment.
How did iteration factor into your development?
As previously stated, keeping a well written block of code to do one repetable thing makes coding much easier.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Instead of rewriting multiple different lines of code, being able to copy and paste certain areas allows for an overall better experience.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
The knowledge of OpenGL will help with different 3D related graphics creations.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
OpenGl will serve as a good basis of other types of 3D modeling, such as Blender.
